<p>Manuel, who didn’t want to release his last name, told ABC13 that he’s had the deer for six years and plans to sell it at an auction Saturday.</p>
<p>He said he owes more than $10,000 in gambling debts.</p>
<p>“I’m desperate. I have to do something,” Manuel said. “I don’t want to lose my house.”</p>
<p>The deer, which is named “Buck”, weighs more than 200 pounds and is 6 feet tall. Manuel said Buck is worth about $1,500.</p>
<p>ABC13 reported that a spokesperson for the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo said the organization has never had anyone try to sell a deer at its auction before.</p>
<h1 id="Manuel-Will-Sell-Buck-To-Pay-Off-Gambling-Debts"><a href="#Manuel-Will-Sell-Buck-To-Pay-Off-Gambling-Debts" class="headerlink" title="Manuel Will Sell Buck To Pay Off Gambling Debts"></a>Manuel Will Sell Buck To Pay Off Gambling Debts</h1><p>A Hail Mary for help in a sticky situation.</p>
<p>That’s what Manuel is hoping for after he agreed to sell his prized buck deer to pay off his gambling debts.</p>
<p>‘I don’t know what else to do,’ said the 37-year-old Penhold man. ‘I’ve already borrowed from family and friends, and I’m running out of options.’</p>
<p>Manuel said he started gambling online about two years ago and has lost about $10,000. He said things spiralled out of control in the past few months after he started betting on live games.</p>
<p>Wildrose MLA Ron Orr is sympathetic to Manuel’s situation but says selling the deer isn’t the solution.</p>
<p>‘It’s very unfortunate that somebody has gotten themselves into this position, but unfortunately killing the deer won’t solve anything,’ Orr said. ‘It will just create more problems down the road.’</p>
<p>Orr is urging Manuel to seek help from Gamblers Anonymous or other support services.</p>
<h1 id="When-Does-Manuel-Decide-To-Sell-Off-Buck"><a href="#When-Does-Manuel-Decide-To-Sell-Off-Buck" class="headerlink" title="When Does Manuel Decide To Sell Off Buck?"></a>When Does Manuel Decide To Sell Off Buck?</h1><p>__</p>
<p>It’s a question on the minds of Bucks’ fans everywhere.  When does head coach, Jason Kidd, decide to pull starting point guard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and put in Malcom Brogdon? Will he keep riding the “Greek Freak” until he drops or will he give the rook a chance to prove himself?</p>
<p>The answer is never easy.  Kidd has to weigh a lot of factors when making a decision such as this. He has to take into account not only the game situation but also how each player is performing that particular night.  The last thing he wants to do is disrupt the rhythm of either player.</p>
<p>In Wednesday night’s game against the Dallas Mavericks, Kidd opted to start Brogdon in the second half.  This came after Giannis had been struggling in the first half, scoring only 7 points on 3-11 shooting.  Kidd said after the game that he made the change because he wanted “a little bit more firepower” on the floor.</p>
<p>It’s interesting to note that this was not the first time that Kidd has made this switch.  He also did it towards the end of last season when Giannis was struggling.  Some people may see this as a sign that Kidd is losing faith in Antetokounmpo but I believe it’s just the opposite.</p>
<p>Kidd knows that Giannis is still growing as a player and that there are going to be times when he struggles.  He also knows that Brogdon can come in and provide a spark off of the bench.  This gives him some flexibility and allows him to keep both players fresh throughout the course of the season.</p>
<p>So far this season, Brogdon has been solid for Milwaukee averaging 9 points and 4 assists per game.  He’s also shooting 42% from 3-point range which is something the Bucks desperately need from their guards.  With Khris Middleton being their only consistent scorer from deep, they can’t afford for their other guards to be ice cold from beyond the arc.</p>
<p>Brogdon has proved himself worthy of starting and I believe we’ll continue to see him get more minutes as the season progresses.  This will give Kidd more options off of the bench and allow him to keep Antetokounmpo fresh for key playoff games later on in the year</p>
<h1 id="Decision-Time-For-Manuel-Sell-Buck-To-payoff-gambling-debts"><a href="#Decision-Time-For-Manuel-Sell-Buck-To-payoff-gambling-debts" class="headerlink" title="Decision Time For Manuel: Sell Buck To payoff gambling debts?"></a>Decision Time For Manuel: Sell Buck To payoff gambling debts?</h1><p>It’s been a long and arduous season for Oakland Athletics’ shortstop, Manuel, as he’s battled through personal demons on and off the field. With the conclusion of the regular season just days away, Manuel faces a critical decision that will impact his future: sell Buck to payoff gambling debts?</p>
<p>On one hand, selling Buck would bring much-needed financial relief to Manuel. He’s already fallen behind on payments to his bookie, and if he can’t come up with the money soon, things could spiral out of control very quickly. Selling Buck would provide him with the cash necessary to catch up on his debts and potentially avoid any serious legal trouble.</p>
<p>On the other hand, selling Buck would be a devastating blow to Manuel’s morale. The two have been inseparable since they were paired up in the minors, and parting ways would undoubtedly be difficult for both of them. Additionally, there’s no guarantee that Manuel would receive a fair price for Buck - he could easily end up getting taken advantage of in a shady deal.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it’s up to Manuel to decide what’s best for him and his ca</p>
<h1 id="Selling-Buck-The-Decision-Manuel-Needs-To-Make"><a href="#Selling-Buck-The-Decision-Manuel-Needs-To-Make" class="headerlink" title="Selling Buck: The Decision Manuel Needs To Make"></a>Selling Buck: The Decision Manuel Needs To Make</h1><p><em>Note: This is a purely speculative article on the future of the Buffalo Bills</em></p>
<p>With Tyrod Taylor firmly entrenched as the starter in Buffalo, there’s one less job up for grabs this offseason. But with a new coaching staff in place, many players will be vying for snaps this summer. One of those players is 2017 third-round pick, Nathan Peterman.</p>
<p> Peterman had an up-and-down rookie season, showing flashes of brilliance but also making some mistakes that led to turnovers. Heading into his second season, Peterman will need to impress the new coaching staff if he wants to see the field.</p>
<p>The Bills drafted Peterman with the idea that he could eventually become their starting quarterback. But with Tyrod Taylor firmly entrenched as the starter, that may not happen anytime soon. The Bills may try to get Peterman on the field in a backup role, but he’ll have competition from AJ McCarron and Cardale Jones for that job.</p>
<p>If I were the Bills, I would trade Peterman this offseason. He has upside but is likely not going to see much playing time in Buffalo behind Taylor. There are many teams around the league who could use a quarterback like Peterman and would be willing to trade for him. Trading him now would give him a chance to start somewhere else and learn another system before potentially becoming the starter down the road.</p>
