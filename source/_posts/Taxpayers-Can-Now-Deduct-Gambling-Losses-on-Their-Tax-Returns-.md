#  Taxpayers Can Now Deduct Gambling Losses on Their Tax Returns 
In a major policy change, the IRS has announced that taxpayers can now deduct gambling losses on their tax returns. The new policy, which went into effect on January 1, 2019, was announced in Revenue Procedure 2018-30.

Under the old policy, taxpayers could only deduct gambling losses if they could prove that they had won at least as much as they had lost. This often proved to be difficult, as it was hard to track all of one's gambling winnings and losses.

The new policy allows taxpayers to simply deduct their gambling losses without having to prove that they won anything in return. This will make it much easier for taxpayers to claim their losses on their tax returns.

The new policy applies to all forms of gambling, including casino games, lottery tickets, and sports betting. Taxpayers can now deduct any gambling losses they incurred in the year, up to the amount of their taxable income.

There are some restrictions on who can claim this deduction. Taxpayers who are subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) cannot take this deduction. Additionally, taxpayers cannot use this deduction to create a net loss for purposes of claiming a tax credit or offsetting other income.

This new policy is good news for taxpayers who enjoy gambling. It will make it easier for them to claim their losses and reduce their taxable income.

#  How to Claim Gambling Losses on Your Taxes 

Are you a gambler? If so, you may be able to claim your gambling losses on your taxes. Here’s how:

1. Keep track of your gambling income and losses. This includes winnings from lotteries, casinos, and any other type of gambling.

2. Report your gambling income and losses on Schedule C. This is the form used to report business income and expenses.

3. Deduct your gambling losses up to the amount of your gambling income. This reduces your taxable income and may lower your tax liability.

It’s important to note that you can only deduct losses up to the amount of your gambling income. If you have $10,000 in gambling income and $7,000 in gambling losses, you can only deduct $7,000 in losses on your taxes.

There are some other things to keep in mind when claiming gambling losses on your taxes:

1. You can only claim losses for games of chance. This includes lotteries, casinos, and any other type of wagering game. You cannot claim losses for betting on sports or horse racing, for example.

2. You must itemize your deductions in order to claim gambling losses. This means you cannot take the standard deduction on your taxes.

3. Gambling losses are considered “ordinary and necessary” business expenses. This means they are deductible even if you do not itemize your deductions.

4. If you have a net loss from gambling, you can carry it forward and deduct it in future years. This means you can offset any taxable income you have in those years with your net gambling loss from this year.
