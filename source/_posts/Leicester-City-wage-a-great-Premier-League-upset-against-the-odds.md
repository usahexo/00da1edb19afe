#  Leicester City wage a great Premier League upset against the odds

Leicester City, who were long shots for relegation at the beginning of the season, pulled off a stunning upset by winning the Premier League against all odds. The Foxes clinched the title on Monday with two weeks to spare after Tottenham’s 2-2 draw against Chelsea.

Claudio Ranieri’s side have been the surprise package of the season, and their remarkable run has included several memorable results such as the 5-2 thrashing of Manchester City and 4-0 demolition of Newcastle United. Leicester only needed three points from their final three games to be crowned champions and they achieved that thanks to Riyad Mahrez’s goals in wins over Everton and Chelsea.

Mahrez was one of Leicester’s standout players this season and he is likely to be rewarded with a move to a bigger club in the summer. Jamie Vardy has also been impressive for Leicester, scoring 22 goals in 34 appearances, and he is expected to receive an England call-up ahead of this summer’s European Championships.

While Leicester will now be looking to build on their title success, many other teams will be focusing on how they can avoid a similar fate in future seasons. The likes of Tottenham, Liverpool and Southampton have all underachieved this year and they will need to strengthen their squads if they are to compete with the top teams next season.

Chelsea and Manchester City are once again favourites for the title next year, but don’t rule out Leicester from repeating their heroics. They have proved that anything is possible in football and they will be sure to give their rivals a run for their money next season.

#  How do sports betting spreads work? Leicester City offers a perfect tutorial

Leicester City's 5,000-1 title win in 2016 had punters around the world frantically trying to learn how betting spreads work. Many were probably still confused after the Foxes' capitulation to Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday night, but with a few basic pointers it is easier than you think to understand this essential part of sports betting.

The principle behind betting spreads is extremely simple. When one team is considered much stronger than the other, the books need to balance things out so that more people are tempted to bet on the underdog. This is done by widening the spread, which is essentially the number of points by which the favourite is expected to win.

For example, if Manchester United are playing Wigan Athletic, bookmakers might give United a handicap of -5.5 (meaning they have to win by six goals or more for punters who back them to collect). If you thought Wigan had a chance of springing an upset, you could back them at +5.5 – they would have to lose by five goals or less for you to make a profit.

The beauty of betting spreads is that they can be applied not just to football matches, but any sport where two teams are competing against each other. For instance, if you think Roger Federer has an excellent chance of beating Rafael Nadal at Wimbledon, you could back Federer at -2.5 games – in essence he would have to lose by three games or less for your bet to be successful.

It's also worth noting that betting spreads can work in both directions. So if you thought Leicester were going to beat Tottenham Hotspur last night, you could have backed them at +4.5 – meaning they would have had to lose by no more than four goals for your bet to come off.

Of course, Leicester City's 5-3 defeat last night means that anyone who backed them lost their money – but that's all part of the excitement of sports betting! With a bit of research and understanding, you too can join in the fun and start making some profits along the way.

#  Shock as Leicester City become favourites for the Premier League title

The internet was in a frenzy on Monday as Leicester City surprisingly became odds-on favourites with many bookmakers to win the Premier League title this season.

Manager Claudio Ranieri has done an incredible job at the King Power Stadium, taking a team who were relegation contenders last season to the top of the table with a number of impressive results.

Leicester are currently two points clear of second-placed Tottenham Hotspur, and many believe that they have what it takes to lift the title in May.

Their odds have shortened considerably in recent weeks, and it is now possible to back them at just 5/4 with some firms to win the league.

This is in stark contrast to the start of the season, when they were available at odds of 1000/1 to be crowned champions.

So how have Leicester managed to pull off this remarkable feat?

Well, their key players have all played a crucial role. Jamie Vardy has been in sensational form up front, scoring 15 goals in the Premier League so far this season. Riyad Mahrez has also been impressive, scoring 11 goals and providing 11 assists.

In addition, N’Golo Kante has been outstanding in midfield, helping to protect the defence while also being very effective in attack. The entire team has worked hard for each other, and they now appear to be playing with a lot of confidence.

It is still early days, and there is a lot of football left to be played, but Leicester City are definitely one of the teams to watch as we head into the final months of the season.

#  How to beat the bookies: A guide to understanding sports betting spreads

In order to beat the bookies, you need to understand sports betting spreads. In this article, we will explain what they are and how they work.

A sports betting spread is a number that is used to create a line in a sporting event. This line determines how much one side is favoured over the other. The favourite is typically given a minus number and the underdog is given a plus number. For example, if the spread for an upcoming game between the New England Patriots and Miami Dolphins was -7, it would mean that the Patriots are 7-point favourites. This means that they are expected to win by seven or more points. If you bet on the Patriots, they would have to win by eight or more points for you to win your bet. If you bet on the Dolphins, they would have to lose by six points or less for you to win your bet.

One of the main things that you need to understand about sports betting spreads is that they are not always accurate. In fact, they often aren't. This is because they are simply created by oddsmakers in order to get an equal amount of money wagered on both sides of the bet. As a result, there is often value to be had when betting on the underdog.

There are a few different ways that you can use sports betting spreads to your advantage:

1) Look for mismatches - When one team is heavily favoured over the other, it often means that there is value to be had on the underdog. For example, if the spread for a game between the New York Giants and Jacksonville Jaguars was -14.5, it would be tough for the Jaguars to cover that spread. As a result, there would be value in betting on them +14.5 points.

2) Bet against public action - When most people are betting on one side of a game, it can often mean that there is value on the other side. This is because most people tend to make bad bets and lose money in the long run. When looking at sports betting spreads, it's important to take into account what percentage of money has been wagered on each side. If most people are betting on one side, then it's probably not a good idea to bet on that side too!

3) Use outside information - In addition to looking at sports betting spreads, it's also important to use outside information when making your bets. This includes information such as injuries, weather conditions, and recent form. All of this information can help you make smarter bets and increase your chances of winning!
