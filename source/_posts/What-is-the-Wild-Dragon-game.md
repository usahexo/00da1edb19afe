The Wild Dragon slot game is a five-reel, three-row, and 20 fixed payline slot machine developed by Novomatic. The game has a medieval theme, and as the name suggests, it features a dragon as the central character. The dragon can award some big wins, especially when it appears stacked on the reels.

In order to play the game, you need to first select your bet amount. This can be done by using the (+) and (-) buttons next to the Bet label at the bottom of the screen. Once you have chosen your bet, you need to hit the Spin button in order to start playing. Alternatively, you can use the AutoPlay function to let the game spin for you automatically.

The Wild Dragon slot machine features four special symbols: the wild symbol (represented by a dragon), the scatter symbol (a shield), the bonus symbol (a castle), and the gamble symbol (a treasure chest). The wild symbol substitutes for all other symbols except for the scatter and bonus symbols. The scatter symbol awards total bet multipliers of 2x, 3x, or 10x when two, three, or four appear anywhere on the reels, respectively. The bonus symbol triggers 10 free spins when three or more appear anywhere on the reels. During free spins, all prizes are tripled. Finally, if you land three or more gamble symbols anywhere on the reels during regular gameplay, you will be taken to a gambling screen where you can attempt to double your prize money.

# What are the Wild Dragon rules?

The Wild Dragon is a creature that inhabits the North American continent. It is a spirit being and considered very powerful. There are specific rules that must be followed in order to safely summon and work with the Wild Dragon.

*First and foremost, one must have pure intentions. The Wild Dragon will not respond to those who seek to use its power for harm.

*There are four specific steps involved in summoning the Wild Dragon- purification, prayer, sacrifice, and declaration.

* Purification is the process of cleansing oneself both mentally and physically in preparation for contact with the spirit world. One must remove all negative thoughts and energy from their being before proceeding.

* Prayer is next, and this involves communicating with the Wild Dragon, seeking its guidance and offering gratitude for any help or assistance received.

* Sacrifice is made in honor of the Dragon, and can be something as simple as making an offering of food or drink, or as elaborate as performing a ritual dance or chant.

* Finally, the declaration is made by stating one's intent aloud. This formally invites the Wild Dragon into one's presence and sets forth the parameters of the working relationship.

After these steps have been completed, it is important to stay open and connected to the spirit world, listening for messages and guidance from the Wild Dragon. In order to maintain positive energy flow and prevent any negative consequences, always heed its advice and never use its power for personal gain or harm against others

# What are the strategies for playing Wild Dragon blackjack online?

There are a few different strategies that can be used when playing Wild Dragon blackjack online. First, it is important to understand the basic rules of the game. The goal is to draw cards totalling 21, or as close to 21 as possible, without going over. Face cards are worth 10 points each, and the remaining cards are worth their face value. A player wins by having a higher total than the dealer, without going over 21.

If the player has a total of 16 or lower, they should hit. If the player has a total of 17 or more, they should stand. If the player has two similar cards (e.g., two 8s), they can split them into two separate hands. If either hand subsequently qualifies for Blackjack (i.e., an Ace and a 10-point card), then that hand will automatically win unless the dealer also has Blackjack.

If the player busts (i.e., their total exceeds 21), then they automatically lose, regardless of what the dealer’s total is. In some variants of blackjack (including Wild Dragon blackjack), there is an optional side bet called Insurance that can be made if the dealer’s first card is an Ace. This wager pays 2:1 if the dealer ends up with Blackjack, which means that it’s effectively a 50% chance bet.

There are a few different strategies that can be used when playing Wild Dragon blackjack online:

- Stand if you have a total of 17 or more
- Hit if you have a total of 16 or less 
- Split any two cards of equal value 
- Take Insurance if the dealer’s first card is an Ace
