#  Largest Monster Hunter Game to Date Released!

Monster Hunter Generations is the newest installment in the Monster Hunter video game series. It was released on the Nintendo 3DS on November 28, 2016, in Japan, and is planned for release internationally in early 2017. The game has been made available for pre-load on the Nintendo eShop in Japan since November 17, 2016.

Monster Hunter Generations builds on the mechanics of previous games in the series, with new features including Styles and Hunter Arts. These new features encourage players to experiment with different combinations of weapons and playstyles to defeat monsters. The game also introduces a new Prowler mode, which allows players to take control of a Felyne companion and hunt monsters either alone or with other players online.

The development of Monster Hunter Generations was overseen by series producer Ryozo Tsujimoto, with assistance from director Yuya Tokuda. Capcom stated that they aimed to create a game that was more accessible for newcomers to the series, while still catering to longtime fans. In contrast to 2012's Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate, which was an upgraded port of two separate titles released on the Nintendo Wii and Nintendo 3DS respectively, Monster Hunter Generations is a completely original title built specifically for the Nintendo 3DS.

The game has received generally favorable reviews from gaming critics. Praise has been directed at the game's graphics and gameplay, while criticism has been leveled at its story and lack of online play outside of Prowler mode.
