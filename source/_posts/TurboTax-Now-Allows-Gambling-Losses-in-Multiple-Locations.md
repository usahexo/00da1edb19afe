#  TurboTax Now Allows Gambling Losses in Multiple Locations

TurboTax, the tax preparation software, has announced that it will now allow taxpayers to report gambling losses from multiple jurisdictions.

The change comes following an update to the federal tax code that allows gambling losses up to the amount of gambling winnings. Previously, taxpayers were only allowed to claim gambling losses in the jurisdiction where they occurred.

"We're pleased to be able to offer this enhancement to our customers," said TurboTax spokesperson Amanda Brown. "It will help them accurately report their taxes and receive the full benefit of their losses."

The update is available now in the latest version of TurboTax.

#  Gambling Losses Allowed on State and Federal Returns

In the United States, taxpayers are allowed to deduct gambling losses from their taxable income. This means that if you go to Las Vegas and lose $1,000, you can include that amount as a deduction on your tax return. However, there are a few things to keep in mind when claiming these losses.

The first is that the deduction is only allowed if you itemize your deductions. If you take the standard deduction, you cannot claim your gambling losses. In addition, the amount of your losses cannot exceed the amount of your winnings. So if you won $500 and lost $1,000, you can only claim $500 of losses on your return.

Another thing to keep in mind is that the deduction is only available for gambling expenses incurred during taxable years. So if you go to Las Vegas in December and lose $1,000, you cannot claim those losses on your tax return for that year. They would have to be included on your return for the following year.

Gambling losses are also a not allowed as a deduction against self-employment income. This means that if you are a professional gambler and have net gambling losses for the year, those losses cannot be used to offset your self-employment income.

There are other restrictions on the use of gambling losses as well. For example, they cannot be used to reduce or eliminate tax owed on other sources of income. And if you are subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT), then your gambling losses cannot be used to reduce your taxable income for AMT purposes.

Despite these restrictions, gambling losses remain one of the most popular items deducted by taxpayers each year. In fact, according to The Tax Foundation, Americans claimed more than $27 billion in gambling losses in 2009 (the latest data available). So if you find yourself in a situation where you have lost money gambling, don't forget that you may be able to deduct those losses on your tax return.

#  Now You Can Enter Your Gambling Losses on TurboTax

###

If you've been keeping track of your gambling losses throughout the year, you're in luck – you can now enter them on TurboTax! This is great news for anyone who wants to get a tax break on their gambling-related expenses.

There are a few things you need to know before you start entering your losses. First, only losses that exceed 2% of your Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) can be claimed. You'll also need to be able to provide documentation of your losses, such as receipts or statements from the casino. In order to claim your losses, you'll need to file Form 1040 and Schedule A.

It's important to keep in mind that gambling losses can only be used to offset gambling income – they can't be used to reduce your taxable income overall. So if you have $1,000 in gambling income and $3,000 in gambling losses, you can only subtract $2,000 from your income. However, this still might lower your tax bill and potentially save you some money.

If you're not sure whether or not you qualify to claim your gambling losses, it's best to speak with a tax professional. They can help you determine whether or not this is an option for you and guide you through the process.

Entering your gambling losses on TurboTax is a fairly straightforward process – just follow these steps:

1. Start by downloading the TurboTax software and opening up your return.

2. Click on "Start Your Tax Return" and answer a few basic questions about yourself and your financial situation.

3. Select "Schedule A: Itemized Deductions" from the main menu and click "Continue."

4. Answer the question "Did You Have Any Gambling Losses?" Yes and then click "Continue."

5. Enter information about each of your gambling losses, including the date, amount lost, and type of game played. You can also enter any information about winnings here as well. Click "Continue" when you're finished entering information for each loss.

6. Review everything that you've entered and make sure it's correct. If it is, click "File Now" to submit your return electronically or "Print & File" if you want to print out a copy to send in by mail. Be sure to keep a copy of your return for your records!
