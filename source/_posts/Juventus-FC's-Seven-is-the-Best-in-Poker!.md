#  Why Juventus FC's Seven is the King of Poker Hands

In poker, the royal flush is the best possible hand. It consists of ace, king, queen, jack and ten all of the same suit. It is also known as a natural royal flush or simply a royal.

As in most other variants of poker, the highest ranking hand wins the pot. A royal flush typically pays out 4000 coins for a five-coin bet, though this varies depending on the game being played.

While it is theoretically possible to make a royal flush with any combination of different suits, it is much more common to see them made with spades, hearts, clubs or diamonds. For example, there are only 4 different suits in a deck of cards so over 52 hands there is only about 1 chance in 13000 that you will be dealt 5 different suits.

In contrast, there are 720 different ways to make a royal flush using one of the four suits. This means that if you are playing with a regular deck of cards, your chances of being dealt this particular hand are about 1 in 649.

So why is the royal flush considered the best possible hand in poker? The answer lies in its combination of high rank and suitedness. The rank is important because it gives you a good chance of winning against lower-ranking hands. And the suitedness means that all of your cards are from the same suit, which increases your chances of making this hand even further.

#  Could Anything Stop Juventus FC's Seven in Poker?

The Bianconeri have been in scintillating form throughout the season and look set to break some records before it's all over.

After their 3-1 victory over Napoli on Saturday night, Juventus have now recorded their seventh consecutive Serie A win. This streak is a new club record, with the previous best being six consecutive league wins. The Old Lady are also just one win away from equalling the all-time Serie A record for most consecutive wins, which is currently held by AS Roma (who achieved eight successive wins in 2002).

This latest victory was not without controversy, however, as referee Gianluca Rocchi ruled out a goal scored by Napoli's Marek Hamsik in the first half. Replays showed that the ball had crossed the line, but Rocchi decided that defender Kalidou Koulibaly had fouled goalkeeper Gigi Buffon in the build-up to the goal.

Juventus took advantage of this stroke of luck and went on to score three goals of their own, through Gonzalo Higuain (2) and Sami Khedira. Napoli pulled one back through Dries Mertens in injury time, but it was too little, too late.

The result leaves Juventus nine points clear of second-placed Roma atthe top of the table. They are also on track to break two more records before the end of the season. Not only could they win an unprecedented seventh consecutive Scudetto championship, but they could also become the first team ever to reach 100 points in a single Serie A campaign.

While Juve have looked near-unstoppable this season, they will still need to be at their best in order to beat AS Monaco in Tuesday's Champions League quarter-final first leg tie. The French side emerged as shock winners against Manchester City in the last round and will be looking to cause an upset against Juventus as well.
