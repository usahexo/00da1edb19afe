#  Why do you think Inter has been so successful this season?

Inter have been one of the most successful clubs in Europe this season, with manager Luciano Spalletti leading them to a second-place finish in Serie A, and a place in next season's Champions League. But why have they been so successful?

There are many reasons for Inter's success this season. Firstly, they have an excellent manager in Luciano Spalletti. Spalletti is a tactical genius, and he has got the best out of his players this season. He has also created a strong team spirit at Inter, which has helped them to win games when they have not been playing well.

Secondly, Inter have some excellent players. Mauro Icardi is one of the best strikers in Europe, and he has scored a lot of goals for them this season. Other players such as Ivan Perisic, Marcelo Brozovic and Antonio Candreva have also played very well for Inter this season.

Finally, Inter have benefited from some good luck this season. They have avoided any serious injuries to their key players, and they have also had some good fortune in terms of the results they have achieved. This luck may not continue next season, but it has certainly helped them this year.

Overall, there are many reasons why Inter have been so successful this season. They have an excellent manager, some excellent players, and they have benefitted from some good luck too. Based on these factors, it is no surprise that they have been so successful and I expect them to be even better next season.

#  Were you surprised when Loescher announced they were going out of business?

In 2001, the Italian company Loescher announced that they were going out of business. This announcement came as a surprise to many, as Loescher was a well-known and respected publisher in Italy. At the time of the announcement, Loescher had over 2,000 employees and annual sales of over 400 million euros.

The company cited increased competition from larger publishers as the reason for their decision to close down. In particular, Loescher blamed the rise of large publishing groups like Bertelsmann and Holtzbrinck for their demise. These companies had been able to rapidly expand by buying up smaller publishers in Europe.

Loescher also pointed to the internet as a major factor in their decision to close down. The internet had allowed readers to access books electronically, which had led to a decline in printed book sales. This was particularly true for educational books, which were one of Loescher's main markets.

Despite its closure, Loescher has left behind a legacy in the publishing industry. During its 101-year history, the company published over 60,000 titles and won numerous awards. Additionally, many of Loescher's former employees have gone on to work at other publishing firms throughout Europe.
