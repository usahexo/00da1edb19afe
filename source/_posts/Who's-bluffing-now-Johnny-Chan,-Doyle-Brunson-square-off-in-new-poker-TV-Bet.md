#  Who's bluffing now? Johnny Chan, Doyle Brunson square off in new poker TV Bet

It's the clash of the titans. Two of the most successful and well-known poker players in the world, Johnny Chan and Doyle Brunson, are about to square off in a new TV Bet.

The two have a long history, with Chan generally seen as the better player. However, Brunson is not one to back down from a challenge and is sure he can take Chan down.

"I may be old, but I can still beat him," said Brunson.

Chan was a little more circumspect in his response. "Doyle is a legend in this game and I have a lot of respect for him," he said. "But I'm confident that I can win."

The two will face off in a heads-up poker match on November 12th with the winner taking home $250,000. The match will be filmed for an upcoming TV show called "The Poker Bettors".

Both players are no strangers to big money matches. Chan has won millions of dollars over his career in high stakes poker games while Brunson has cashed in for over $6 million at the World Series of Poker alone.

Chan heads into the match as the favourite but Brunson is not one to be counted out. He has proved time and time again that he is one of the best poker players in the world and he will be looking to add another scalp to his collection when he takes on Chan next month.

Two of poker’s most legendary players are set to go head-to-head on a new TV betting show. The show, which is provisionally titled ‘Poker showdown: Chan vs. Brunson’, will see Johnny Chan and Doyle Brunson compete against each other in a series of poker challenges.

The 10-episode series is set to be filmed at the world-famous Bellagio casino in Las Vegas, and will be aired on CBS Sports Network later this year. In each episode, the two players will compete in a different type of poker game, with the winner taking home a cash prize.

Both Chan and Brunson are considered to be some of the greatest players in poker history, with dozens of major titles between them. They have also both been inducted into the Poker Hall of Fame, and now they will finally have the chance to face off against each other in person.

Chan is one of the most successful tournament players in history, having won 10 World Series of Poker (WSOP) bracelets. He is also the only player to have won both the main event and the $50,000 buy-in High Roller event at the WSOP.

Brunson, meanwhile, is a legendary cash game player who has won millions of dollars playing live poker games. He is also the author of several popular books on poker strategy.

The new TV show is not the first time that Chan and Brunson have faced off against each other. The two players previously played together in a heads-up Sit & Go tournament on Poker Night in America back in 2016. Chan ended up winning that match, but it’s unclear who will come out on top this time around.

Doyle Brunson and Phil Hellmuth will go head-to-head in a new poker TV Bet show, according to a recent report.

The two poker veterans will battle it out in a series of challenges with the loser paying up $10,000 to the winner. The challenges will apparently be filmed at the end of this month and will be aired on CBS Sports Network.

“This is going to be so much fun,” said Brunson. “Phil and I have been battling each other for decades, but this is the first time we’ve ever put any money on it. I can’t wait to see him squirm when I start whipping him.”

Hellmuth was quick to respond, saying “Doyle is in for a real surprise. I’ve been practicing hard and I plan on coming out on top. He may have won more money than me over the years, but this time the money is going to me.”

Brunson has long been considered one of the greatest poker players of all time, having won ten World Series of Poker bracelets throughout his career. Hellmuth is no slouch either, with 14 WSOP bracelets of his own.

The two have had a long-standing rivalry that has seen both players take their share of wins and losses over the years. This new TV Bet show looks sure to add another chapter to their story.
