#  PSG boss Emery outlines precisely how to program slot machines
Paris Saint-Germain coach Unai Emery has outlined how to win at slot machines, insisting there is a precise method to earning rewards from the games of chance.

"It's all about making the right choices and being patient," Emery told reporters. "You need to start with a small bet and then increase it gradually as you see fit."

Emery, who himself is something of a slot machine enthusiast, went on to say that there are certain times of day when playing at slots is more advantageous than others.

"I usually like to play in the evening, after dinner," he said. "That's when the casinos are busiest and the machines are most likely to pay out."

The Spanish manager also warned against relying too much on luck when playing slots.

"Yes, luck is important, but it's only one part of the equation," he said. "You also need to make good strategic decisions if you want to come out ahead."

Paris Saint-Germain manager Unai Emery has been sharing his wisdom with his squad this week, in an attempt to help them beat the casino.

Emery has reportedly been telling his players how to play slot machines in order to maximise their chances of winning. He is said to have shown them how to calculate the right amount to bet, and when to cash out.

PSG's Brazilian superstar Neymar was among those who took part in the tutorial from Emery, and he said he was impressed by the knowledge the manager shared.

"Emery knows a lot about gambling," Neymar said. "He showed us how to beat the casino and make a bit of money. It was really useful."

The techniques that Emery has taught his players are not new, but they are still effective nonetheless. By following his advice, PSG may be able to give themselves a competitive edge over their rivals both domestically and in Europe.

#  Paris Saint-Germain manager provides blueprint for how to win at slot machines

Paris Saint-Germain manager Unai Emery has provided his blueprint for how to win at slot machines - and it is surprisingly simple.

The Spaniard has revealed that the secret to victory lies in backing a single colour and only changing when things are not going your way.

“You have to make sure you pick a colour and stick with it,” Emery told BeIn Sports. “And when you’re not winning, don’t be afraid to change to another colour.”

Emery also believes that it is important to use your intuition when playing slots, adding: “I always try to use my intuition when I play slots. Sometimes I feel like a particular colour is going to win, so I’ll stick with that. Other times, I might feel like another colour is more likely to come up, so I’ll switch to that.”

The PSG boss says he has had a lot of success with this approach, adding: “I’ve been using this method for a while now and it’s worked well for me. I’ve won a lot of money by sticking with one colour and changing only when things aren’t going my way.”

#  Emery reveals how to make a fortune from Paris Saint-Germain's slot machines.

Paris Saint-Germain is one of the richest football clubs in the world. This season, they will receive a total of €820 million from domestic and European competitions, more than any other French club. However, this wealth has not always been there.

In 1970, the president of PSG at the time, Charles Bonnet, decided to install slot machines in the club’s stadium in order to increase revenue. At first, this decision was very successful and generated a lot of money for the club. However, over time, PSG began to rely too much on the profits from these machines and started to lose money.

In 1997, PSG’s new president Michel Platini decided to get rid of the slot machines and focus on developing the football team. The gamble paid off and PSG became one of the biggest clubs in Europe.

Today, PSG is once again looking to increase its revenue and president Nasser Al-Khelaifi has decided to revive the slot machines project. This time, however, he plans to do it right and make a fortune from them.
