#  Crvena zvezda Joining Elite Blackjack Club

Only three months ago, Crvena zvezda was a team to avoid in the Europa League. But they’ve had an amazing turnaround, culminating in their qualification for the Champions League group stage on Tuesday night.

Some experts say that this is a new Crvena zvezda side, reborn under manager Miodrag Božović. The Serbian has been in charge since December, and his changes seem to have had a galvanising effect on the players.

A few big-name signings have helped too. Đorđe Ivanović came in from Lokomotiv Moscow, while Richmond Boakye-Yiadom arrived from Red Star Belgrade – the club’s bitter rivals. Both players are experienced and have played at a high level.

But it’s not just about the new arrivals; there are some homegrown stars too. Captain Filip Kostić has been one of Crvena zvezda’s most reliable performers in recent years, and he’s been ably supported by midfielder Nenad Krstičić and goalkeeper Predrag Rajković.

The fans have been behind the team all the way, and they were rewarded with some great displays in the Europa League this year. Away victories against Akhisarspor and Olympiacos will live long in the memory, as will last week’s dramatic 3-2 defeat of Young Boys at home.

Now they face even tougher opposition in Group D of the Champions League, where they’ll be up against Liverpool, Napoli and Paris Saint-Germain. But if Crvena zvezda can reproduce their Europa League form then they could cause an upset or two.
